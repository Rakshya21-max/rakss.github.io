          <h2>When Life Gets Tough...</h2>
          <p>
            If you start feeling you are falling apart and even when you are trying all you could and still it doesn't feel right,
            remember these steps to keep your heart strong and hope alive:
          </p>
             <ul>
              <li>Take a deep breath. Pause and let yourself feel what you need to feel.</li>
              <li>Reach out to someone you trust. You donâ€™t have to carry everything alone.</li>
              <li>Break your problems into small steps and tackle one at a time.</li>
              <li>Remember, itâ€™s okay to rest. Recharge your mind and body.</li>
              <li>Focus on what you can control, and let go of what you cannot.</li>
              <li>Keep reminding yourself: you are stronger than you think.</li>
              <li>Celebrate small wins, no matter how tiny they seem.</li>
              <li>Believe in the light at the end of the tunnel â€” itâ€™s there.</li>
              <li>Be kind to yourself, always.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Sending you a big virtual hug! ðŸ¤—ðŸ’–</p>
